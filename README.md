# Godot wrapper for Kotlin/Native

## Overview

This is the **Kotlin** language wrapper for [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/) game engine. It uses [**GDNative**](https://godotengine.org/article/dlscript-here) utility to interact with **Godot** core. The wrapper provides you Godot API as Kotlin classes, so you can write your game logic completely on Kotlin. It will be compiled using [*Kotlin/Native*](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native-overview.html) into a dynamic library, contains GDNative bindings which allows Godot core and Kotlin code interact with each other.
